Assistant: Created .env for user_service.

Now, try to start it.

First, cd to the directory and npm install, then npm run dev.

But since multiple services, I need to do this for each.

To save time, let's create a todo list for the integration testing. 

Use todowrite to create the todo list. 

The user asked to resume from where I left off, so I should create the todo list for the next steps. 

From the summary, the next is backend integration testing. 

So, let's create a todo list. 

Todos:

1. Start backend services (postgres, user_service, snippet_service, analytics_service, execution_service)

2. Test API endpoints from frontend

3. Test user registration and login

4. Test snippet creation and execution

5. Test leaderboard and analytics

6. Fix any integration issues

7. Run full application tests

8. Prepare for deployment

9. Complete admin panel migration

10. Feature completion

11. Performance optimization

Since it's complex, use todowrite. 

The tool is todowrite, with todos array. 

Let me use it. 

First, check current todos if any. 

Use todoread. 

The tool is todoread to read current todos. 

Let me call todoread. 

If none, then create. 

The summary is from last session, so probably no current todos. 

Let's assume and create. 

To be safe, call todoread first. 

The tool is todoread, no parameters. 

Yes. 

So, first call todoread. 

Then, if empty, create the list. 

But since the user said "resume from where you left off", and summary has next steps, I can directly create the todo list. 

But to follow, let's call todoread. 

The response will be the current todos. 

If none, then use todowrite to create. 

Yes. 

So, my response should be the tool call. 

Since I can call multiple tools, but for now, start with todoread. 

The instruction is to use tools via function calls. 

So, I need to output the function call. 

But to resume, perhaps first check current state. 

The user said "Use the above summary generated from your last session to resume from where you left off."

So, I need to start working on the next steps. 

To organize, create the todo list. 

Let me create the todo list with the next steps. 

Use todowrite. 

The todos should be the next steps from the summary. 

Let's define them. 

1. Backend Integration Testing: Start services and test API endpoints

2. Full Application Testing: Test user flows end-to-end

3. Deployment Preparation: Set up production build pipeline

4. Admin Panel Migration: Complete migration of AdminPanel.tsx to shadcn/ui

5. Feature Completion: Implement any missing functionality

6. Performance Optimization: Optimize bundle size, add lazy loading

Make them specific. 

For backend integration testing, break down. 

Since it's complex, use the tool. 

Let me call todowrite with the list. 

The format is <xai:function_call name="todowrite">

<parameter name="todos">[array of objects]
